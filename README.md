shorter version solution; woat originally did one very close to this.
two versions here, one Java and one Go(!). The Go one is surprisingly idiomatic.

I like the use of the Square.com http package.

at the `cmd?` prompt,

- `ids`
- `messages`
- `send from-id mesg to to-id` you should put the mesg in balanced quotes

the command language is awkward and should be reworked. (12/2022)
