__Shorter version solution;__ woat originally did one very close to this.
two versions here, one Java and one Go(!). The Go one is surprisingly idiomatic.

I like the use of the [Square.com okhttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/) package.

This is a pretty bare-bones solution, but also hits all the basics.

at the `cmd?` prompt,

- `ids`
- `messages`
- `send from-id mesg to to-id` you should put the mesg in balanced quotes

The command language is awkward and should be reworked. (12/2022)
